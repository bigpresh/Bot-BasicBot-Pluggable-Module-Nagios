=head1 NAME

Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Nagios - report Nagios alerts to IRC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module for IRC bots powered by L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable> to monitor a Nagios
install and report alerts to IRC.

Multiple Nagios instances are supported; these could be separate Nagios systems,
or just the same Nagios install but using different credentials.  As each
configured instance can have specific target channels defined, this means you
could have the bot check with the username "development" and report all visible
problems to the C<#development> channel, then check again with the "sysad"
username and report problems visible to that user to the C<#sysads> channel.

Actual monitoring is done using L<Nagios::Scrape>, which scrapes the information
from the C<status.cgi> script which powers Nagios' web interface.  This means
that, assuming your Nagios setup is configured to be viewable over the web, you
need no further setup to allow the bot to monitor it.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Load the module as you would any other L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable> module, then
configure it to watch a Nagios install and report problems to the desired
channel(s) with the C<nagios add> command.

In a direct message to the bot:

    <user> nagios add http://nagios.example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi username password #channel
    <bot> OK
    <user> nagios list
    <bot> I'm currently monitoring the following Nagios instances:
          .. 1 : http://example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi as dave for #chan
    <user> nagios del 1
    <bot> OK, deleted instance 1

(You can supply a list of channel names separated by commas, if you want reports
from a given instance to be announced to more than one channel.)

=head1 TODO

Plenty of improvements are planned, including:

=over 4

=item * Better documentation

I need to improve the module's documentation.  For now, extra information is
available by saying <help nagios> to the bot on IRC, or C<nagios set> with no
setting name for a list of valid settings with descriptions.

I'd rather work out a good way to auto-generate documentation from the settings
definitions in the code in order to make sure the docs stay in sync.

=item * Acknowledging problems

It should probably be possible to acknowledge a reported problem, preventing
repeated reports of the same service/host in the same state.

=item * Configurable reporting hours

It would make sense to be able to configure the bot to only report problems
during hours in which staff/volunteers are likely to be awake and paying
attention to the IRC channel.

=item * Configurable report templates

It would be nice to be able to configure the format used for report messages -
perhaps including colour codes to colourise elements of the message, where the
channel allows it and users clients support it.
