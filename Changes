Revision history for Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-Nagios

0.06    2018-01-19
        Change commands to be prefixed with "!" (e.g. "!nagios set") so that
        the Auth module can protect them.

0.05    2017-01-11
        Report failure to poll Nagios - added UPDATE_FAIL to report_statuses
        list to configure whether to report or not

        Test that we can poll a new instance before adding it, if not, refuse
        to store it, and return the error we got

        New 'filter_services' option, to take a regex of services which should
        be ignored.

        Bugfix: don't say e.g. "OK, set report_statuses to 'ARRAY(0x2669fc8)"

0.04    2011-10-21
        Configurable repeat_delay, poll_interval and report_statuses settings.

0.03    2011-10-19
        Bugfix: services in state 'OK' always stay at attempt e.g. 1/4; don't
        skip over them, otherwise we can't report service problems resolved.

0.02    2011-10-18
        Don't alarm on initial check attempts - e.g. check 1/4, don't alarm
        until 4/4.  Should avoid alarming for brief problems.

0.01    2011-10-15
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
