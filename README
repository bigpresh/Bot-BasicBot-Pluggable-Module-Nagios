NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Nagios - report Nagios alerts to IRC

DESCRIPTION
    A module for IRC bots powered by Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable to monitor a
    Nagios install and report alerts to IRC.

SYNOPSIS
    Load the module as you would any other Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable module,
    then configure it to watch a Nagios install and report problems to the
    desired channel(s) with the `nagios add' command.

    In a direct message to the bot:

        <user> nagios add http://nagios.example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi username password #channel
        <bot> OK
        <user> nagios list
        <bot> I'm currently monitoring the following Nagios instances:
              .. 1 : http://example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi as dave for #chan
        <user> nagios del 1
        <bot> OK, deleted instance 1
